This respo is specifically for those who would like to learn machine learning on your own. 

I will start from regression modeling, and then i will decide what to include in this repos

I will include most popular statistical modeling technique in this repos so that you can have all the idea of how it works

1) Regression
		- Linear Regression Essentials in R <br />
		- Interaction Effect in Multiple Regression: Essentials. <br />
		- Regression with Categorical Variables: Dummy Coding Essentials in R. <br />
		- Nonlinear Regression Essentials in R: Polynomial and Spline Regression Models. <br />
		- Simple Linear Regression in R. <br />
		- Multiple Linear Regression in R. <br />
		- Predict in R: Model Predictions and Confidence Intervals. <br />
2) Regression Model Diagnostics. <br />
		- Linear Regression Assumptions and Diagnostics in R: Essentials. <br />
		- Multicollinearity Essentials and VIF in R ( im currently on this section).    <br />
		- Confounding Variable Essentials. <br />

The list will be updated
