# Machine leanring
This respo is specifically for those who would like to learn machine learning on your own. 

I will start from regression modeling, and I will include most popular statistical modeling techniques in this repos so that you can have all the idea of how it works.

I would suggest you to use .rmd and work along with mine to see the result. Pdf version is for you to revise what is going on.

Also, "ML_LinearRegression.pdf" is all the libraries and functions are being used in this tutorial.

			+	In Principal Component and Partial Least Squares Regression Essentials, I have come across an error from caret library. <br/>
			+	Here is the error code.<br/>
			+	"Error in UseMethod("R2") :  no applicable method for 'R2' applied to an object of class "c('double', 'numeric')"<br/>
			+	The way I solve the problem is by adding carett:: in the front, full code-> caret::R2(prediction.object, test.data)<br/>
