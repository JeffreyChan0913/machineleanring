This respo is specifically for those who would like to learn machine learning on your own. 

I will start from regression modeling, and I will include most popular statistical modeling techniques in this repos so that you can have all the idea of how it works.

I would suggest you to use .rmd and work along with mine to see the result. Pdf version is for you to revise what is going on.

Also, "ML_LinearRegression.pdf" is all the libraries and functions are being used in this tutorial. Last update: Dec 27, 2020
